# life-heroku

The purpose of the project is to design a model for predicting Life Expectancy rate of a
Country given various features such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people
in the country,Expenditure on health care system and some specific disease related deaths
that happened in the country are given.This project analyses the provided data set and
creates a model to predict life expectancy and machine learning can benefit public health
researchers with analyzing thousands of variables to obtain data regarding life expectancy.

Model development part is complete, but the deployment is still on the way.
